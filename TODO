Tasks

* Split out game and game engine?
  * update myriad-worlds to use DreamSSH?
  * myriad-worlds is very large in scope, though... designed for full-on RPG
    games
  * perhaps a DreamMUD?

* Find all occurances of inversum and change them to dreammud

* Add a custom shell, not a python prompt
  * Integrate code from OpenPIX (commands, autocompletion)
  * Copy OpenPIX shell code into inversum.shell.gameshell

* Integrate code from Myriad Worlds (moving from room to room)
  * update myriad-worlds to support map types
  * currently, it supports rooms/dungeons
  * update it to support terrain as well

* Add environment info to status bar/area
    * Display time, day/night/sun location, weather, month, season, year, etc.
    * Allow for time multipliers (for slower or faster moving time)

* Support live-updating the game
  * edit the maps in-game
  * update room descriptions in-game

* Add support for game roles
  * limit contents of namespace based on role

* Add classes:

* Provide a service for usres to login anonymously:
  * maybe the lobby?
  * create a user account (via telnet)
  * choose a class
  * upload SSH keys (via https)

* Add support for shared sessions
  * we want to be able to provide a shell where everyone that logs in sees what
    everyone else is doing
  * this can be prototyped in the sandbox
  * this should be as easy as setting up a singleton session...

* Add generic support for roles
  * provide a mechanism whereby programmers can create roles, and
  * assign different APIs or limited APIs to roles

* Add phased login
  * a login to create an account
  * provide a user name
  * provide a URL for SSH keys
  * keep a global cache of ssh keys and don't allow new user-creation if ssh
    keys are already present
  * allow for this code to be extendable
  * if anonymous, do phase 1 login
  * if not anonymous, do a full login
  * provide for the ability to define what the anonymous user name is
    * make the default anonymous user "signup"
